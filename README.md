# SuperCap-Python!

A Supercapacitor modelling library for Python

## Overview
SuperCap-Python, a toolset for super capacitor modelling and simulation consisting of Python packages. It can be used to performing high-fidelity simulations of charge, discharge and self-discharge processes of super capacitors.
